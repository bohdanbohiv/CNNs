# TensorFlow ML Zero to Hero
Here is some code I wrote while going through a
[course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQY2H8rRoyvwWuPiWnuTDBHe7I0fMSsfO)
by Laurence Moroney. These projects showcase TensorFlow, NumPy and Matplotlib
and mostly contain code for defining, training and dissecting the corresponding
Convolutional Neural Network model.

## Hello World
Create a nn that behaves like y=2x-1.

## Convolution and Pooling
Shows convolution and pooling with NumPy.

## Fashion
Build, train, and evaluate a convolutional neural network on the Fashion MNIST
dataset. It also visualizes the feature maps from the convolutional and pooling
layers for better interpretability of learned features. Achieved accuracy is
about 90%.

## Horse or Human

## Cats and Dogs

## Rock Paper Scissors
